# Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project
Project Overview

The Machine Learning for User Classification project is a data-driven initiative designed to apply machine learning algorithms to predict whether students on 365's online learning platform will upgrade from a free plan to a paid one. This classification problem involves analyzing student engagement metrics, including the number of days spent on the platform, minutes of watched content, and the number of courses started.

Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide valuable insights for 365 and similar online companies by predicting potential customers who are likely to upgrade from a free plan. The outcomes of this analysis can be instrumental in targeted advertisement strategies and the delivery of exclusive offers. By allocating resources and marketing efforts to users more likely to benefit from the premium services, the company aims to enhance revenue and overall customer satisfaction.

Key Components
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Examine student engagement metrics and explore the dataset structure.
Handle any missing values or outliers in the data.
Prepare the dataset for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Machine Learning Models:

Train several classification models, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests.
Evaluate and compare the performance of each model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dealing with Imbalanced Data:

Acknowledge the heavily imbalanced dataset, where the number of students likely to keep their free plan exceeds those predicted to purchase.
Research and implement different data resampling methods, such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE, to address the imbalance.
Model Evaluation and Optimization:

Fine-tune the models for optimal performance using hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluate the models on both training and testing datasets to ensure robust generalization.
Business Insights:

Interpret the model results to gain insights into the key features influencing the upgrade decision.
Provide actionable recommendations for marketing strategies based on the model's predictions.
Importance of Imbalanced Data
While dealing with the imbalanced dataset is acknowledged in this project, successful completion does not hinge on resolving the imbalance. However, researchers are encouraged to explore various data resampling methods to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

This project not only contributes to enhancing revenue through targeted marketing but also demonstrates the applicability of machine learning in understanding and predicting user behaviors.
